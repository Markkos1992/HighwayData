There is very little information available about these routes' exact alignments. However, there are a bunch of [signs](https://www.google.com/maps/@-7.7024813,113.9213964,3a,15y,81.31h,111.93t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s2Xl8cRXLq21R4IOR92jc4A!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D-21.93291278637983%26panoid%3D2Xl8cRXLq21R4IOR92jc4A%26yaw%3D81.31142493895395!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDEyOS4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) that show it following surface routes even where a parallel freeway exists. The [2010 log](https://www.unescap.org/our-work/transport/asian-highway/database) (the latest available) uses some freeways, so any freeways that existed at this time are included. https://www.eria.org/Chapter3.pdf (particularly p. 11) shows the three-digit ASEAN routes.

Notes from the 2010 log:
* AH2's east end seems to be on Jl Gatot Subroto at Jl Cokroaminoto in Denpasar (the first segment is listed as 11 km in the 2010 log, which makes no sense, but it's clearly shown as following 40.008.K, which may have been longer in 2010? or was the section completely moved? some sections on Java were totally renumbered, and the length does roughly match ending at the airport on N1)
* AH2 may have used part of N1 thru Surabaya - or was part of T8 originally built as N1?
* AH2 is signed both [via Kartasura](https://www.google.com/maps/@-7.3618754,111.119484,3a,15.7y,65.9h,107.9t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s5n-RI-71jRxUbE-0xsLfxg!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D-17.897237823115617%26panoid%3D5n-RI-71jRxUbE-0xsLfxg%26yaw%3D65.90055468083914!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDIwNS4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) and [via Tuban](https://www.google.com/maps/@-7.0998329,112.1787094,3a,43y,214.02h,103.18t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s0gwX2tXao2aDIHo-N5lGjg!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D-13.184867156328991%26panoid%3D0gwX2tXao2aDIHo-N5lGjg%26yaw%3D214.01725166948972!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDIwNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D).

* AH2's Bandung spur seems to stay with T4 all the way to Cileunyi.
* AH2 appears to use both sides of the T1/T2/T7 loop around downtown Jakarta as well as the spur of T1 to the port/ferry.

* AH150 may bypass Banjarmasin (both routes are nationally maintained).
* AH150 may bypass Palangka Raya (both routes are nationally maintained).
* The endpoints of the spurs of AH150 may be wrong.
* It's not clear which side of the Yogyakarta bypass AH152 follows; both are different national routes.
