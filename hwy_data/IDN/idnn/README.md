Notes on routes (Jawa):
* Alignments thru Jakarta are from the 2007 log (note that N2 and N12 are now N8 and N6, and N13 no longer exists).
* N1 goes both ways thru Cikarang per the 2019 log, but the bypass is mapped because the downtown route cannot be followed westbound.
* N1 uses Jalan Ir. H. Juanda in Cikampek per the 2019 log, but it [is not signed this way](https://www.google.com/maps/@-6.4082123,107.4866307,3a,15.9y,224.13h,108.12t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1smqhkoSGpDe1vCAg7M9-hjw!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D-18.122681498273593%26panoid%3DmqhkoSGpDe1vCAg7M9-hjw%26yaw%3D224.13487536007761!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDEyOS4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) (as of 2024).

* N10 southbound uses a different route thru Padalarang. Since only the northbound route is nationally maintained, and several important points are on the northbound route's overlap with N11, that direction is mapped.
* N11's route thru Bandung may be wrong (a northern route is also nationally maintained).
* N11's east end may be wrong (Jalan Pilang Raya etc. is also nationally maintained).

* N32 may bypass downtown Madiun (both routes are nationally maintained).

Notes on routes (Bali):
* The junction of N3/N4/N5 may be wrong (the 2019 log shows N3 entering on Jalan HOS Cokroaminoto, with presumably N5 on Jalan Gatot Subroto west of there).
* N6's exact north end may be wrong.

Notes on routes (Sumatera):
* The maps in the 2019 log show many branches that are not listed in text. These are not mapped unless explicitly signed. There is also a lot of inconsistency between the list and maps (for example, what the list calls N21 is a second N31 on the maps, and what the maps call N21 doesn't seem to be un the list. There is even disagreement between maps; the Sumatera Barat map shows N15 but the Jambi map shows N19 for what is N15 in the list.

Most other signs point around Dumai, and there seem to be no signs at the turns in Dumai. Thus the bypass has been mapped (both routes are nationally maintained).

* N5 is assumed to bypass Bandar Lampung, so N52 can intersect it (both routes are nationally maintained).
* N7 may bypass Bandar Lampung (both routes are nationally maintained).
* N9's north end may be wrong (the route into downtown Kabanjahe is also nationally maintained) - or is this N6?
* N9 may bypass Parapat (both routes are nationally maintained).
* N10's north end is assumed due to the configuration of one-way streets in Tarutung (the direct route east to N5 is also nationally maintained).
* N10's south end may be wrong (the bypass is also nationally maintained).
* N13 does not seem to be nationally maintained, so it may no longer exist.
* N17 is not on the maps in the 2019 log, and the one in the list is mapped as N21.
* N19 is not on the maps in the 2019 log, except as part of N15, and the one in the list is mapped as N25.
* N31 or N33 may use the nationally-maintained eastern bypass of Pangkalpinang (the 2019 log is unclear).
* N32 may go thru downtown Jambi (both routes are nationally maintained).
* N45 may have been rerouted onto a more direct route via Jalan DI Panjaitan and Jalan WR Supratman in eastern Tanjung Pinang; the longer route is explicitly stated in the 2019 log but may be no longer nationally maintained.
