**NOTES TO ROUTES:**
- `D10`: A4 wp is indicated "1" on OSM, D41 wp "2", Z3079 wp "3" et cetera. However, D41 is "1" on GSV, Z3079 "2" et cetera. The recently opened segment (September 2016) is not yet on GSV but numbered with "1" and "2" on OSM again! BM is like GSV but the new segment is missing. I've decided to go with A3, D41, Z3070 et cetera wp labels for the time being.
- Numbering is usually not used on signage but there are km posts which are quite small and hard to find. I've checked 15 routes only and I always found a km post! At additional 2 routes GSV and GM still had old numbering. For that reason, I'll rely on wikipedia and OSM only.
- `D132` appeared on the 2024 route log, exact location unknown, see https://www.openstreetmap.org/note/4585235, not in HB
- `D431` is 400m only, exact location unknown: "Slavonski Brod (DC53 – GPC zona Đ. Đaković)", not in HB
- `D433` routing unknown despite being well described: "Solin (DC432) – Ulica salonitanskih mučenika – Zagorski put – Ulica domovinskog rata – Split (DC8)", not in HB
- `D435` appeared on the 2024 route log, exact location unknown, see https://www.openstreetmap.org/note/4585274 (the "luka TEF" seems to be still under construction as-of January 2025), not in HB
- `D542` routing unknown, not yet existing? "Zajci (DC64) – Polje Čepić (DC500)", not in HB
- `D545` should be extended to D228 but that's u/c or even not yet u/c (but visible on German OSM as-of January 2025), not in HB
- `D677` is not in 2024 route log but indicated on OSM for a new route, its extension is still u/c, might be renamed later, maybe `D1` realignment? (note: D600s do usually only appear for a short period of time)
- `D682` is not in 2024 route log but indicated on OSM for old `D44`, might be removed later (note: D600s do usually only appear for a short period of time)
- `Z2268`appeared on the 2024 route log (0.3km), seems to be a future route from `D41` to the Hungarian border, not in HB
- `Z3305`appeared on the 2024 route log (16.3km), seems to be a future route, not in HB
- `Z4302`appeared on the 2024 route log (1.4km), seems to be a future route, not in HB
- `Z5219`appeared on the 2024 route log (7.9km), seems to be a future route (Novi Vinodolski bypass?) or old `D8`/`D99`(?), not in HB
- `Z6267`appeared on the 2024 route log (0.5km), exact location unknown, not in HB
