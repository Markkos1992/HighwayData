Routes are very sparsely signed and most (especially secondary routes) are completely unsigned. [Some secondary shields exist](https://www.google.com/maps/@10.818491,122.6997183,3a,41.2y,179.82h,85.69t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sHscOfMIz0J6bYsVornyFFg!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D4.307289138617236%26panoid%3DHscOfMIz0J6bYsVornyFFg%26yaw%3D179.8249684032548!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDQwMi4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) (though this is actually on N655, not N508). All are included regardless of signage status.
