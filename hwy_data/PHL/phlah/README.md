Notes on routes:
* AH27Lap may use N82 or N841; the description simply lists a branch from Cebu City to Lapu-Lapu City.
* AH28Bat begins at Calamba City; the GIS Nautical Highway data shows a different alignment of E2 than what was built, so it's assumed that AH28 uses E2 south of the Calamba City interchange.
