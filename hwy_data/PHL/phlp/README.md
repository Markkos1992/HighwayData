Routes are very sparsely signed and most (especially secondary routes) are completely unsigned. All are included regardless of signage status.

Notes on routes:
* N4 has two branches at the north end in GIS data, one as mapped and the other forking left at SanTom_S to end at former N1 (now an unnumbered tertiary route).
* N9 is shown in GIS data going thru the centers of Dampil and Gitagum. The former [is explicitly signed as Dampil-Lagonglong By-Pass Road](https://www.google.com/maps/@8.8245818,124.7916816,3a,43y,309.9h,85.18t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sxWneHzuvnMsY2HuS1LBtSQ!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D4.818222603099329%26panoid%3DxWneHzuvnMsY2HuS1LBtSQ%26yaw%3D309.8988775678378!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDQwMi4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) (going thru the center) and the latter is partially abandoned, so neither is mapped as such.
* N70 is shown in GIS data going thru Camp Downes, with the main road being [a named tertiary road](https://www.google.com/maps/@10.9998583,124.6153391,3a,15.9y,144.76h,91.81t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s7xwtCVsKsVpcOvBiwULgHg!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D-1.8126928552192112%26panoid%3D7xwtCVsKsVpcOvBiwULgHg%26yaw%3D144.76258320164516!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDMxOS4yIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). This is not mapped because Camp Downes is closed to the public.
