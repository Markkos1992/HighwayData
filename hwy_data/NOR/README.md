**NOTES TO ROUTES:**
- All routes with 4-digit numbers are secondary fylkesveier; all 2-/3-digit Fv routes drafted for norfv system
- `Fv155` segment from E18 to east of E6 is a municipal road of Oslo city and only signed with dotted frame which means "to Fv155" according to GSV from 2016; confirmed by vegvesen.no; segment not drafted
- `Ring 2` (former `Fv161`) is a municipal road of Oslo city but signed like Fv routes; drafted as `Ring 2` only
- `Ring 1` is signed like `Ring 2` but state-owned `Rv162` according to wikipedia but no `Rv162` signs according to GSV from 2016; drafted as `Ring 1` only
- `Fv168` eastern segment is a municipal road of Oslo city and not signed according to GSV from 2016 (was signed in 2010 though)
- `Fv313` is interrupted because the Holmestrandtunnelen is closed since 2012 https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holmestrandtunnelen
- `Fv568` has a very short segment (0.03mi) on Fedje island but I couldn't see any sign on GSV
- `Fv589` is only the southbound tunnel (Sydnestunnelen in Bergen) of the northern segment from `Fv588`: not drafted
