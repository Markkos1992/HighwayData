* Narathiwat: Nth -> Nthw

Notes on routes:
* Bk3015 is not in the 2023 log, but it [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@18.0710412,104.1153158,3a,20.6y,236.85h,87.22t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s3yhl2BRqTqI4HaRSxhgGcg!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D2.77562112936117%26panoid%3D3yhl2BRqTqI4HaRSxhgGcg%26yaw%3D236.85239405316912!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDExMC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) (as of 2023). It is assumed to reach Bk4015, but available imagery at that end is too old.
* Br3048 [is signed as such](https://www.google.com/maps/@14.9864052,103.1205356,3a,37.6y,15.83h,85t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1spq4gT5_mqP2qUPr3fQopOg!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D4.998318693928169%26panoid%3Dpq4gT5_mqP2qUPr3fQopOg%26yaw%3D15.83021194267089!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTExOS4yIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) (as of 2022), despite the 2023 log (and numbering system) calling it Br4048.
* Br5053's east end may be wrong.

* Br5071's exact west end may be wrong; it is based on a length of 10.2 km.
* Cb4012's north end may be wrong.

* Chch029's south end may be wrong.
* Chch3028 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@13.6925166,100.8651376,3a,16.8y,96.36h,90.88t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sqvZH0QYAfRIwFKmYcQ8tRg!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D-0.8794132031643898%26panoid%3DqvZH0QYAfRIwFKmYcQ8tRg%26yaw%3D96.36352313669514!7i16384!8i8192?coh=205410&entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTAwMi4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) from Chch3001, but there is probably nothing else south of the end as shown in the 2023 log, and the route in between is cut by a railroad.
* Chch4043 is not in the 2023 log, but it [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@13.492848,101.5447495,3a,75y,168.79h,71.49t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1ssnOig0QEcgPJ8U67nKnXyA!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D18.506296208017943%26panoid%3DsnOig0QEcgPJ8U67nKnXyA%26yaw%3D168.79419593404543!7i16384!8i8192?coh=205410&entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTAwMi4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) (as of 2024).

Since the sign looks old, and no other signage can be found, it is assumed to no longer exist.

At its east end, the 2023 log calls it Skw7091.
* Chm4030's north end is probably wrong.
* Chm4039's north end may be wrong.
* Chm3044's south end may be wrong; the 2023 log seems to show it continuing to Lph2047, but there is no good road or signage south of the mapped end.
* Chm4049's alignment may be wrong.
* Chm4055 seems to be unsigned (as of 2024), but there is only imagery near the south end.
* Chm3059's north end may be wrong.
